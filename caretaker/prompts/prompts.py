# Right now we are going to just have multiple prompts available.
# Choose one, pass in the values and hope we get an answer.

# In the future need a system of, hopefully selecting the appropriate prompt
# for each model. 

# Thinking logically:
# Each prompt is likely to have following components. Which components 
# get added to a prompt can be dependent on parameters? Context length, etc?
# 1. Instruction
# 2. Context
# 3. Constraints (list of requirements, formatting rules, etc.)
# 4. Examples
# 5. Expected output format. 
# 6. Tone and style
